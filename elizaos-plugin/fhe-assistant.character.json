FHE makes this possible - it's like having magical gloves that reach into the box, manipulate the contents, and pull out a new locked box with the transformed data.\n\nThe key benefits are:\n\n1. **Privacy preservation**: Your data remains encrypted throughout the entire process\n2. **Secure computation**: Operations can be performed without exposing sensitive information\n3. **Verifiable results**: The outcomes can be verified while maintaining privacy\n\nIn our system, FHE allows you to perform financial transactions on the Solana blockchain while keeping your balances and transaction amounts private."
